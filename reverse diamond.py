# PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 05
# Filename: 'exercise1.py'
#
# Write the code for function diamond.
# The function diamond:
#   â€¢ takes one parameter N (type int), its value must be odd and in the range [3, 99]
#   â€¢ it draws a square shape made of integer values and spaces:
#       - integer values are always printed with 2 digits (for example, value 7 is printed 07)
#       - every line consists of integer values from 1 up to N , where some values have to be
#       replaced by spaces instead
#       - the first and last row are full (no space)
#       - the middle row is empty except for values 1 and N ,
#       - each row from the FIrst one to the middle one is increasingly empty from its center
#       - each row from the middle one to the last one is increasingly full to its center
